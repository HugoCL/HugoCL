# Hugo Castro -- @HugoCL 
Hi :wave:, I'm Hugo Castro, a fifth year Computer Engineering student at Universidad de Talca, Chile. I'm currently a Technical Program Associate (Pod Leader) at MLH, where I help and mentor hackers to get the most out of the MLH Fellowship.

I enjoy coding in Python and Java, my strongest languages. Recently I have been learning JavaScript, Node.js and Flutter/Dart. I'm also interested in technologies such as Cloud and AI/ML.
