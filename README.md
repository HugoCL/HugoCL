# Hugo Castro -- @HugoCL 
Hi :wave:, I'm Hugo Castro, a fourth year Computer Engineering student at Universidad de Talca, Chile. I'm currently Hablaqu√≠'s CTO, a startup where we are building a SaaS app to help psychologists and patients connect in a private and safe space.

I enjoy coding in Python and Java, my strongest languages. Recently I have been learning JavaScript and Node.js as part of my Backend Developer Job. I'm also interested in technologies such as Cloud and AI/ML.
